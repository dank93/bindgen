## For sure
- CXXopt
    - includes, etc
- fail if file cannot be parsed completely
- warn about unsupported stuff
    - stl
    - c-style arrays
    - binding not structs / classes
- docs
- clean code up
    - format
    - hpp / cpp

## Maybe
- flesh out tests?
- tab-complete in ipython?
- plugins? (kind of defeats purpose...)
- member functions?
- c-style arrays?
- make types opaque?
